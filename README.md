# RajasthanITDay 💪🏻
The basic and fundamental idea of this project is to provide clean and cold drinking water to the masses, which is still a problem in rural areas, and even modern India. 🇮🇳<br>

The solution for this is, to create a device, which can be fitted onto current taps, and generate instant cooling water. This device is also portable, which means can be transferred from tap to tap conviniently. 🕺 <br>

#### This device has some key features : <br>
<ul>
  <li> This device produces INSTANT cooled water from taps.</li>
  <li> For example, on an average day, it can turn a water of temprature 40 degree celcius to around 16-17 degree celcius, immidiately.</li>
  <li> It runs on only 60W Power </li>
  <li> Since it takes so less power, it can be run using solar panels </li>
  <li> Very cost efficient, can be produced for a mere 500 rupees 🖐🏻 </li>
  <li> A very low maintenance machine, returns 1 lakh hours of output </li>
  <li> Also can be manufactured as a device, whose temprature can be controlled over the mobile phone. </li>
</ul>  

## Working: <br>
The device works by using a sensor named as a Peltier, which on passing electricity, turns one of it's surface to a chilled surface and one to a hot surface. So, attatched to it is a water block, which looks after the passing of water. Once the surface of the peltier is cooled, it makes the water block cold, and the water passing through the block is cooled automatically to a drastically low temprature. It works on 60W of power, and can be modified to run on solar power.
